Command: add
Usage:
nei add {task} -desc {description}


The `add` command adds a task to the task list. Both {task} and {description} must be enclosed in quotation marks if they contain spaces.
The add command needs two additional arguments to be passed when called, one which is optional.
The {task} argument is always neccessary, but the {description} argument is not and is optional for in case you want add additional informationt to the task. For example:
nei add "Homework ssignment" -desc "This assignment must be done before 12 am." 
you can omit the -desc argument if you don't plan on adding additional information.

Examples:
1. Single-word arguments with no spaces:
   nei add TaskName -desc Description
   - Here since the task name and description does not contain any word, you can omit the parenthesis.

2. Multi-word arguments with spaces:
   nei add "This task" -desc" This is the description"

   In this case:
   - The task is "This task"
   - The description is "This is the description"
   - Since there are spaces here, you need the parenthesis for the input to be valid.
